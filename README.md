
Fraud Detection - End-to-End Machine Learning Project


ðŸ“Œ Overview


This project aims to build a fraud detection system for e-commerce and banking transactions.


It includes data preprocessing, model training, explainability, API development, and a dashboard.



ðŸ“‚ Datasets


Fraud_Data.csv - E-commerce transaction data with fraud labels.<br>
IpAddress_to_Country.csv - Maps IP addresses to country locations.<br>
creditcard.csv - Credit card transaction data (with PCA-transformed features).<br>
ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Data Analysis & Preprocessing<br>
âœ… Steps Performed<br>
Handled missing values using imputation techniques.<br>
Removed duplicates and corrected data types.<br>
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand fraud trends.<br>
Merged datasets to include geolocation data from IP addresses.<br>
Engineered new features such as:<br>
Transaction frequency<br>
Time-based features (hour of day, day of week)<br>
Normalized numerical features and encoded categorical variables.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Model Training<br>
âœ… Steps Performed<br>
Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.<br>
Trained multiple models:<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Decision Tree<br>
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Neural Networks (MLP)
Evaluated models using:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
Used MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.
ðŸ“Œ Task 3: Model Explainability
âœ… Steps Performed
Used SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to:
Identify important features contributing to fraud detection.
Generate SHAP Summary, Force, and Dependence plots.
Used LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to:
Explain individual fraud predictions.
Generate Feature Importance plots for better interpretability.
ðŸ“Œ Task 4: Model Deployment & API Development
âœ… Steps Performed
Built a Flask API to serve fraud predictions.
API supports real-time predictions using a trained model.
Created a Dockerfile to containerize the API.
Steps to build and run the Docker container:
docker build -t fraud-detection-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 fraud-detection-api

ðŸ“Œ Task 5: Dashboard Devlopment
This task focuses on building an interactive dashboard to visualize fraud detection insights using Dash (Plotly).
The dashboard provides real-time analytics on fraudulent transactions, trends, and distribution.

ðŸŽ¯ Features
âœ… Display total transactions, fraud cases, and fraud percentage.
âœ… Visualize fraud trends over time using a line chart.
âœ… Analyze fraud occurrences across devices and browsers using bar charts.
